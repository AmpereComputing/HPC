# HPC


## Introduction

High Performance Computing (HPC) is the use of advanced computing technologies and techniques to solve complex problems that would be too difficult or time-consuming to solve using traditional computing methods. HPC systems are designed to deliver high levels of performance, often leveraging parallel processing, accelerators like GPUs, and high-speed networking technologies to provide fast, efficient computations. 

HPC is used in a wide range of fields, from scientific research and engineering to finance and entertainment. Some of the problems solved by HPC include simulations of complex systems such as weather forecasting, modeling of chemical and biological systems, optimization of industrial processes, and analysis of large data sets in fields such as genomics and social media. In many cases, these problems are so large and complex that traditional computing methods would take years or even decades to solve, but with HPC, they can be tackled in a matter of hours or days. The use of HPC enables researchers and industry professionals to make more informed decisions, develop new technologies, and advance our understanding of the world around us. 

## Ampere Processors for HPC 

Ampere processors are well suited for HPC workloads because they have very high core counts, consistent operating frequencies and are designed with power efficiency in mind.  The Ampere Altra Family of processors include 8 memory channels supporting DDR4-3200 and 128 cores in the Altra Max series or 80 cores in the Altra series. The Altra family of processors also has 128 lanes of PCIe Gen4 to support accelerators, networking and NVMe storage. 

The high core count of Altra Family processors allows for workloads to scale
