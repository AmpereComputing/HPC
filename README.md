## Introduction

Ampere Cloud Native processors are well suited for some HPC workloads because they have very high core counts, consistent operating frequencies and are designed with power efficiency in mind.  In this repository we provide a configuration files, examples and instructions to run common HPC benchmarks on Armpere CPUs. This repository is maintained by the Solution Architecture team at Ampere Computing. Many of these examples include the use of [Arm Performance libraries](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries), [Arm Compiler for Linux](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-compiler-for-linux) and/or [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis) to achieve the best performance.

This repository includes examples for HPL, GROMACS, WRF, OpenFOAM, SpecFem3D and Quatum Espresso.
